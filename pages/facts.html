      <h1>7 Deadly Sins Theory</h1>
      <p class="bubble-glow">According to the theory, <span id="spongebob">SpongeBob</span> embodies lust—not in a romantic sense, but in his overwhelming enthusiasm and constant craving for life, friendship, and fun. <span id="patrick">Patrick</span> represents sloth because of his endless naps and famously lazy lifestyle. <span id="squidward">Squidward</span> aligns with wrath, always irritated and quick to snap at his neighbors. <span id="mr-Krabs">Mr. Krabs</span> fits greed through his obsession with money. <span id="sandy">Sandy</span> represents pride, confident in her intellect, inventions, and identity as a land mammal in the sea. <span id="plankton">Plankton</span> embodies envy due to his constant jealousy of the Krusty Krab’s success. Finally, <span id="gary">Gary</span>   embodies gluttony, shown through his enormous appetite and food-motivated behavior. <br> <span id="disclaimer">While the show has never confirmed it, fans love interpreting the cast through this symbolic lens, adding a playful layer of depth beneath the comedy.</span></p>

    <h1>Random Facts</h1>
    <ul class="no-bullets">
      <li>
          <h2>Secret Ingredient Theories</h2>
        <p class="bubble-glow">Some fans believe the special ingredient is nothing more than clever marketing from Mr. Krabs, since he’s the only one who ever mentions a “secret.” Others point out that Mr. Krabs is strangely protective of the formula, locking it up like buried treasure and reacting dramatically whenever Plankton gets close. Theories range from the recipe being something simple—like love or sea salt—to something darker, all supported by the fact that Bikini Bottom residents treat Krabby Patties like an addictive delicacy.</p></li>
      <li>
          <h2>The Mystery of the Missing Crabs</h2>
        <p class="bubble-glow">Fans noticed that aside from the brief “Krusty Krab training video” reunion cameo, there are almost no other crabs in the show. This led to humorous (and creepy) speculation that the Krusty Krab is actually made from old crab traps, or that the “secret recipe” involves something related to crabs themselves. While the show never confirms anything, the emptiness of Mr. Krabs’ species in the main cast has become one of the series’ biggest running mysteries among fans.</p></li>
      <li>
          <h2>Davey Jones' Cameo</h2>
        <p class="bubble-glow">In the episode where he appears, he isn't a ghostly pirate captain but a literal cameo from the musician of the same name, whose locker is treated like a bizarre afterlife storage room for lost socks and junk. The show loves transforming real-life concepts into undersea absurdity, and Davey Jones is one of the clearest examples—turning an old sailor legend into a cheerful, confused celebrity cameo who lives in a dusty nautical closet.</p></li>
